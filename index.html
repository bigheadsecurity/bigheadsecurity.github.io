      <h2>WE BELIEVE IN CREATIVE IDEAS</h2>
      <p>An individual who uses computer, networking, or other skills to solve a technical issue is known as a hacker. The phrase can also be used to describe someone who uses their skills to break into systems or networks without authorization in order to commit crimes. For instance, a hacker might take someone else's information to harm them through identity theft, or they might bring down a system and frequently hold it hostage in exchange for a ransom. </p>
      <p>Afer using many third party security solutions, buinesses are still facing cyber attacks because many time system fail to detect malicious computer viruses that sent by a hacker and easily system get compromised.</p>
      <p>To overcome this issue, we recommend to do a penetratin testing assessments where our team perform a simulated hacking assessment and dig out the possible attacking vectors.</p>
